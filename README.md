# Detetonist

AI based deep analysis of signal tones as produced by metal detectors in order to identify targets using advanced analysis of audio signals as produced by multi-tonal detectors. Instead of algorithmic target ID, it relies on AI analysis of the signals, and classification is learned based on human-in-the-loop training while in the field.

The application listens to audio signals and offers the user voice-based accept/reject of targets, in order to refine the model.
